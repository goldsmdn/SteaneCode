# SteaneCode
MSc Steane Code project

The following workbooks are included:

 - *Basic_single_qubit_errors.ipynb* : confirms our understanding of the measurement and depolarizing error channel
 - *Egan_single_qubit_errors.ipynb* :  simulation of single qubit errors to compare a qiskit noise model with experiments by Egan
 - *Basic_two_qubit_errors.ipynb* : confirms our understanding of the two gate noise measured as a tensor product of a depolarising channel on each qubit
 - *Egan_two_qubit_errors.ipynb* : simulates the results shown in Egan's paper
 - *Bacon_Shor.ipynb* : simulation of the Bacon_Shor code using the SteaneCodeLogicalQubit class 

For documentation of the SteaneCodeLogicalQubit class please see the automatically produced [documentation](https://goldsmdn.github.io/SteaneCode/).

Please see the [Pipecleaning repository](https://github.com/goldsmdn/Pipecleaning_test) for the initial work from which the baseline files were copied.
