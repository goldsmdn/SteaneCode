=============

This program documentation is generated by Sphinx automatically after each GitHub update.  

Please also refer to README.MD for an overview of the Jupyter Notebooks
and to the Jupyter Notebooks for detailed documentation.

Sphinx is triggered to build the documentation by Travis Continuous Integration (CI) 
based on configuration is stored in the file .travis.yml.  Sphinx reads static .rst files and the docutexts in the python code.  
This ensures that the documentation is always up to date.
